<h1 class="accordion_toggle">One Year Research Engineer Position - Web Developer - RESTful Web APIs, Semantic Web, Web of Things - (Java, JavaScript)</h1>

<p>In the context of a research collaboration with a major French company in the energy domain, <a href="https://www.armines.net/">ARMINES</a> recruits a research engineer for a one year position in the <a href="https://connected-intelligence.univ-st-etienne.fr">Connected Intelligence</a> team, Hubert Curien Laboratory, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/J5b8PWzWMwn">Saint-Étienne, France</a>.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>The Internet and the Web nowadays connect not only humans, not only machines, but a variety of communicating things with variable resources and roles. It is a complex task to make systems interoperable on a Web that comprises various protocols (HTTP, CoAP, MQTT), data formats (XML, JSON, CBOR, Protocol Buffer, Turtle), data models (schemas, ontologies), and services (measuring, controlling, forecasting, requesting). As concrete examples, suppose the following things are interconnected on the Web:</p>

<ul>
 <li>a smart energy meter, that regularly publishes data in CBOR format via MQTT;</li>
 <li>an electric vehicle smart key, intermittently accessible via CoAP, capable of sensing temperature and level of CO<sub>2</sub>, capable of beeping and flashing;</li>
 <li>a home server capable of aggregating data from by these sensors, to control them, to process and react to some events, reason with simple rules, and be reachable from anywhere via HTTP;</li>
 <li>the home or the electric vehicle owner's smartphone;</li>
 <li>a powerful server on the cloud that exposes energy price forecasting services, or weather forecasting services.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the <em>Connected Intelligence</em> team, we are interested in making these various interconnected things interoperable. More specifically, we are developing solutions that make use of the Web of Data and the Semantic Web standards and formalisms. Originally, these formalisms focus on things (i) with reasonable computational resources, and (ii) connected via HTTP. We hence research how to make the Semantic Web formalisms applicable to things with constrained resources, that use other protocols (CoAP, MQTT), and lighter data formats (CBOR, Protocol Buffers).</p>


<h2>Keywords</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application domain</strong> - Smart-Grids, Smart Energy Management, Home Management Systems</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Domains</strong> - Web, Semantic Web, Web of Things.</li>
<li><strong>Production Environment</strong> - Java EE/Web, Glassfish Web Server.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Missions</h2>

<p>The research engineer hired on this project for ARMINES will develop web demonstrators for the work of the team. Among other, he will be asked to:
<ol>
<li>Maintain and enhance an extension of Apache Jena (Java) that enables the on-the-fly support of custom RDF datatypes [1,2], and develop and expose web demonstrators.</li>
<li>Enhance SPARQL-Generate [3], and develop and expose web demonstrators.</li>
<li>Implement SPARQL-Template on top of Jena [4].</li>
<li>Enhance the documentation website of some ontologies developed by the team (for instance, [5]).</li>
<!--<li>Develop solutions on top of JAX-RS to help our partner develop a semantic platform, whose aim is to link things with various computational resources, that expose various services, with various data formats, on top of various protocols. This solution will be based on top of [5,6,7].</li>-->
